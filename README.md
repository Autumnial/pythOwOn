# PythOwOn


## Intro
PythOwOn is a silly little project i decided to make after seeing [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/vkkyyv/say_hello_to_pythowo_make_sure_to_treat_her_well/) . It is just a simple lexer  (probably) that turns OwO-ified python code into actual python code, and then runs it.

## How To Use 
```python
instructions on how to use PythOwOn will be here, once its a thing.
curr idea:

...thats about it tbh

sample code may be akin to:

ewse: 
 # more code
```
