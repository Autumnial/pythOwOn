# PythOwOn


## Intro
PythOwOn is a silly little project i decided to make after seeing [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/vkkyyv/say_hello_to_pythowo_make_sure_to_treat_her_well/) . It is just a simple parser that turns OwO-ified python code into actual python code, and then runs it!

### I'm working on a language plugin for Pythowon! [check it out here!](https://github.com/Autumnial/PythOwOn-language-plugin)

## How To Use 
for now, you simply run the code using `cargo run [filepath]`. a better way is coming in the future!

example code:
```python
pwint('hewwo, wowd!')
```

```python
if True:
    pwint("pythOwOn!")
ewse: 
    pwint("ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢")

```

currently, only the keywords `pwint`, `ewse`, and `ewif` work, more coming very soon!
